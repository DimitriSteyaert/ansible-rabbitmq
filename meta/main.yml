  synopsis: |
    This role installs and configures a RabbitMQ server (with the version of your choice) and lets you setup a RabbitMQ cluster.
  usage: |
    If you just enable this role on your machine(s) then you perform a basic RabbitMQ server installation with the latest version. But by tweaking the role variables you can choose to install another version of RabbitMQ server or setup a RabbitMQ cluster. You can also choose to let Ansible manage your vhosts, queues, exchanges and users by filling up these arrays. Just follow the examples below to realise this.
